                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I wanted a way to easily keep track of my measurements. I considered making a Google form and adding
                    it to my phone's home screen and using a complicated Google Sheets formula to automatically graph
                    new data and average things out, but I decided against that. This app allows me to enter data
                    whenever and as often as I would like and automatically graphs it and shows me average values so I
                    can get a better feel for the data trend at any given time. What's more, I have some friends who
                    were interested in tracking their measurements as well, so I used Devise authentication to allow
                    multiple users to have separate data.</p>

                <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn authentication with <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise">Devise</a></li>
                    <li>Learn how to update multiple models at once in Rails</li>
                    <li>Find some good Ruby gems</li>
                    <li>Use a CSS framework</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>This was only my second Rails project, but I wanted to be able to use it as soon as possible, so I
                    tried to stay within what I knew I could do while also making a UX that felt right to me.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The gems <a href="https://github.com/ankane/chartkick">chartkick</a> and <a
                            href="https://github.com/mhuggins/ruby-measurement">ruby-measurement</a>. I may add a
                        feature to ruby-measurement to group measurements and not display the whole list</li>
                    <li>Authentication using <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise">Devise</a>. It seems to be
                        the go-to option for Rails, and after this I think that is because of its customizability. There
                        is still plenty for me to learn about it if I want, even though I have a basic grasp of it now
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="https://milligram.io">Milligram</a> (though I didn't use it for the final release)</li>
                    <li><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> (but there is still a lot of work to do
                        there before it looks good on most devices)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Project Shortcomings and Obstacles</h2>
                <p>This project has been easier than the <a href="/projects/ac-tracker.html">Animal Crossing
                        Tracker</a>. I was less ambitious with the features, so that makes sense. However, I did solve
                    some problems in this project that I could not solve in the other.</p>
                <p>First is updating single or multiple ActiveRecord objects from a single form. Maybe I've spent too
                    much time on the internet and now I can see the code or something, but when designing the data input
                    page, I could feel how it should work. The user should be able to enter data into any of their
                    trackers and then submit it all with one button press. By default in Rails, one would expect to go
                    to a page for each tracker, create a new data point, enter a value, and then repeat. But I really
                    needed this to be simple.</p>
                <p>It did take a little while to figure out, but I eventually got it working. Another problem I ran into
                    I was less patient with. The first CSS framework I used was <a
                        href="https://milligram.io">Milligram</a>, which is beautiful and effective and not what I
                    wanted <i>exactly</i> so I stopped using it. After looking around, it seemed like <a
                        href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a> was favored by the Rails crowd. However, I had
                    never done any responsive CSS, so I ended up getting the site's features working long before I got
                    its design working.</p>
                <p>At first I didn't understand how Tailwind was supposed to work, since it seemed very much unlike CSS
                    I had done prior. Now I have got the hang of it more, but I haven't gone back and made the design
                    work well on most devices.</p>
