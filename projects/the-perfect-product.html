                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I came across this project while practicing full stack development with the curriculum from <a href="https://theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>.  The challenge was to create a product landing page, which immediately made me think of the song "The Perfect Product" by TWRP.  So I challenged myself to build the page but use only copy taken directly from the song lyrics.</p>
                <p>Most of the programming I did in school was not web based - that I've learned on my own.  I do a lot of extra practice to try to get my skills to a level where I feel confident at any part of the stack.  Styling on the front end is probably my weakest point, or at least it was before taking this on.</p>
                <p>I took influence form cyberpunk art to make this page.  A lot of bright pinks and blues, with neon effects.</p>

                <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Practice using CSS with no framework</li>
                    <li>Make a site that is somewhat responsive (try checking it out on a phone vs. a desktop)</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>My <a href="https://annabaker.design">wife</a> is a graphic designer, UI/UX designer, and front-end developer and swears by CSS Grid.  I can ask her anything about Grid and she'll be able to help me.  That's why for most of the spacing and layout I used Flexbox.  The goal was to be unable to look for her help, and to figure things out 'on my own.'  Now I think I have a good handle on using Flexbox.  I also got to practice using SVG images, which I obviously like for their scalability.</p>
